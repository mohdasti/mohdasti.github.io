## Welcome to My blog

I began this blog on the 8th day of quarantine. We're in the midst of a global pandemic and self-isolation. On the bright side, this created a good opportunity to create something helpful. I don't know for how long I will be at home or how things will end up, but for now, I am commited to work on this blog. Create some helpful contents, talk about things I enjoy and hopefully, entertain some readers.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mohdasti/mohdasti.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files. 

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mohdasti/mohdasti.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
